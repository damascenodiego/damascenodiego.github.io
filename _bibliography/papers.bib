    abstract="Thousands of vulnerabilities are reported on a monthly basis to security repositories, such as the National Vulnerability Database. Among these vulnerabilities, software misconfiguration is one of the top 10 security risks for web applications. With this large influx of vulnerability reports, software fingerprinting has become a highly desired capability to discover distinctive and efficient signatures and recognize reportedly vulnerable software implementations. Due to the exponential worst-case complexity of fingerprint matching, designing more efficient methods for fingerprinting becomes highly desirable, especially for variability-intensive systems where optional features add another exponential factor to its analysis. This position paper presents our vision of a framework that lifts model learning and family-based analysis principles to software fingerprinting. In this framework, we propose unifying databases of signatures into a featured finite state machine and using presence conditions to specify whether and in which circumstances a given input-output trace is observed. We believe feature-based signatures can aid performance improvements by reducing the size of fingerprints under analysis.",

Having a clearer understanding of feature interactions in practice can help practitioners to select appropriate quality assurance techniques for their systems and researchers to guide further research efforts. In this paper, we present pdparser, a Python-based tool for analysing structural feature interactions in software systems developed with C and C++ preprocessor. Our tool relies on a lightweight methodology to quantify the frequency of pairwise and higher-order feature interactions and the percentage of code affected by them. We showcase the individual characteristics brought forward by the automated analysis of one toy example and two open-source text editors: Vim and Emacs.

Model learning aims to construct behavioral models. Due to the commonalities among the products of an SPL, it is possible to reuse the previously-learned models during the model learning process. In this paper, an adaptive approach, called PL*, for learning the product models of an SPL is presented based on the well-known L* algorithm. In this method, after learning each product, the sequences in the final observation table are stored in a repository which is used to initialize the observation table of the remaining products. The proposed algorithm is evaluated on two open-source SPLs and the learning cost is measured in terms of the number of rounds, resets, and input symbols. The results show that for complex SPLs, the total learning cost of PL* is significantly lower than that of the non-adaptive method in terms of all three metrics. Furthermore, it is observed that the order of learning products affects the efficiency of PL*. We introduce a heuristic to determine an ordering which reduces the total cost of adaptive learning.},

    abstract = {Behavioral models are the key enablers for behavioral analysis of Software Product Lines (SPL), including testing and model checking. Active model learning comes to the rescue when family behavioral models are non-existent or outdated. A key challenge on active model learning is to detect commonalities and variability efficiently and combine them into concise family models. Benchmarks and their associated metrics will play a key role in shaping the research agenda in this promising field and provide an effective means for comparing and identifying relative strengths and weaknesses in the forthcoming techniques. In this challenge, we seek benchmarks to evaluate the efficiency (e.g., learning time and memory footprint) and effectiveness (e.g., conciseness and accuracy of family models) of active model learning methods in the software product line context. These benchmark sets must contain the structural and behavioral variability models of at least one SPL. Each SPL in a benchmark must contain products that requires more than one round of model learning with respect to the basic active learning L* algorithm. Alternatively, tools supporting the synthesis of artificial benchmark models are also welcome.},

    abstract = {Sharing research artifacts is known to help people to build upon existing knowledge, adopt novel contributions in practice, and increase the chances of papers receiving attention. In Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), openly providing research artifacts plays a key role, even more so as the community targets a broader use of AI techniques, which can only become feasible if large open datasets and confidence measures for their quality are available. However, the current lack of common discipline-specific guidelines for research data sharing opens the opportunity for misunderstandings about the true potential of research artifacts and subjective expectations regarding artifact quality. To address this issue, we introduce a set of guidelines for artifact sharing specifically tailored to MDE research. To design this guidelines set, we systematically analyzed general-purpose artifact sharing practices of major computer science venues and tailored them to the MDE domain. Subsequently, we conducted an online survey with 90 researchers and practitioners with expertise in MDE. We investigated our participants’ experiences in developing and sharing artifacts in MDE research and the challenges encountered while doing so. We then asked them to prioritize each of our guidelines as essential, desirable, or unnecessary. Finally, we asked them to evaluate our guidelines with respect to clarity, completeness, and relevance. In each of these dimensions, our guidelines were assessed positively by more than 92\% of the participants. To foster the reproducibility and reusability of our results, we make the full set of generated artifacts available in an open repository at https://mdeartifacts.github.io/.},

	abstract = {Family-based behavioral analysis operates on a single specification artifact, referred to as family model, annotated with feature constraints to express behavioral variability in terms of conditional states and transitions. Family-based behavioral modeling paves the way for efficient model-based analysis of software product lines. Family-based behavioral model learning incorporates feature model analysis and model learning principles to efficiently unify product models into a family model and integrate the behavior of various products into a behavioral family model. Albeit reasonably effective, the exhaustive analysis of product lines is often infeasible due to the potentially exponential number of valid configurations. In this paper, we first present a family-based behavioral model learning techniques, called FFSMDiff. Subsequently, we report on our experience on learning family models by employing product sampling. Using 105 products of six product lines expressed in terms of Mealy machines, we evaluate the precision of family models learned from products selected from different settings of the T-wise product sampling criterion. We show that product sampling can lead to models as precise as those learned by exhaustive analysis and hence, reduce the costs for family model learning.},

    abstract = {Substantial effort has been spent on extending specification notations and their associated
    reasoning techniques to software product lines (SPLs). Family-based analysis techniques
    operate on a single artifact, referred to as a family model, that is annotated with
    variability constraints. This modeling approach paves the way for efficient model-based
    testing and model checking for SPLs. Albeit reasonably efficient, the creation and
    maintenance of family models tend to be time consuming and error-prone, especially
    if there are crosscutting features. To tackle this issue, we introduce FFSMDiff, a
    fully automated technique to learn featured finite state machines (FFSM), a family-based
    formalism that unifies Mealy Machines from SPLs into a single representation. Our
    technique incorporates variability to compare and merge Mealy machines and annotate
    states and transitions with feature constraints. We evaluate our technique using 34
    products derived from three different SPLs. Our results support the hypothesis that
    families of Mealy machines can be effectively merged into succinct FFSMs with fewer
    states, especially if there is high feature sharing among products. These indicate
    that FFSMDiff is an efficient family-based model learning technique.},

    abstract="Access control systems demand rigorous verification and validation approaches, otherwise, they can end up with security breaches. Finite state machines based testing has been successfully applied to RBAC systems and enabled to obtain effective test cases, but very expensive. To deal with the cost of these test suites, test prioritization techniques can be applied to improve fault detection along test execution. Recent studies have shown that similarity functions can be very efficient at prioritizing test cases. This technique is named similarity testing and assumes the hypothesis that resembling test cases tend to have similar fault detection capabilities. Thus, there is no gain from similar test cases, and fault detection ratio can be improved if test diversity increases.",

    abstract    = {Access control mechanisms demand rigorous software testing approaches, otherwise they can end up with security flaws. Finite state machines (FSM) have been used for testing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) mechanisms and complete, but significantly large, test suites can be obtained. Experimental studies have shown that recent FSM testing methods can reduce the overall test suite length for random FSMs. However, since the similarity between random FSMs and these specifying RBAC mechanisms is unclear, these outcomes cannot be necessarily generalized to RBAC. In this paper, we compare the characteristics and effectiveness of test suites generated by traditional and recent FSM testing methods for RBAC policies specified as FSM models. The methods W, HSI and SPY were applied on RBAC policies specified as FSMs and the test suites obtained were evaluated considering test characteristics (number of resets, average test case length, and test suite length) and effectiveness on the RBAC fault domain. Our results corroborate some outcomes of previous investigations in which test suites presented different characteristics. On average, the SPY method generated test suites with 32% less resets, average test case length 78% greater than W and HSI, and overall length 46% lower. There were no differences among FSM testing methods for RBAC regarding effectiveness. However, the SPY method significantly reduced the overall test suite length and the number of resets.},

    abstract={Systems-of-Systems are a class of systems composed of diverse, independent constituent systems. Together, these constituents can accomplish missions that otherwise could not be performed by any of them separately. In another perspective, knowledge representation approaches can assist in the establishment of a common understanding in this field by formalizing and standardizing the main terms and concepts adopted. In spite of the relevance of SoS, a consolidated terminology which could support the community working with such systems is still missing. Furthermore, the multiplicity of stakeholders, technologies, and expertise involved in an SoS makes the need of a common understanding even more imperative. In this study, we report on the main findings of a systematic literature review covering knowledge representation approaches in the SoS field. With this study, we are able to present a comprehensive panorama of the knowledge representation approaches that are currently adopted. Even though a consolidated terminology is not available yet, such panorama can be helpful for devising a common, comprehensive terminology for the SoS field. Therefore, we conclude this paper with directions for future work.},
