I am happy to announce that the paper "A Tool for Analysing Higher-Order Feature Interactions in Preprocessor Annotations in C and C++ Projects" 
has been accepted in the [SPLC'22 - Tool Track](https://2022.splc.net/).
This paper is the result of a research internship of David Korsmann, 
a Master's student at Radbod University.
A preprint is available in my [Publications page](https://damascenodiego.github.io/publications/).
