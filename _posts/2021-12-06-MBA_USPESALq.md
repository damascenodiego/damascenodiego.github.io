After two years of a lot of learning, today I am completing my 
Master of Business Administration (MBA) in Project Management at 
the "Luiz de Queiroz" School of Agriculture (USP/ESALQ - São Paulo). 👨🏾‍🎓

The course covered more than 60 modules that showed me a new world of problems 
that I am eager to explore in the next comming years.
This course definitely made me to rethink my ideal of **scientific research of quality** and 
how quality of research artifacts can be addressed! ✨

A preprint of my final year project is avaliable in 
my [publications page](/publications).
