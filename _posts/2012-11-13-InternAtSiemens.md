I started working at Siemens Corporate Research, in Princeton, New Jersey (USA).
There I worked on the **design** and **development** of 
features and maintenance of a project named 
[**Tedeso**](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10515-012-0118-3), 
an extensible and interoperable [**Model-Based Testing (MBT)**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-based_testing) 
platform developed to facilitate **automatic generation of tests**, while supporting the needs of different 
stakeholders in a diverse and broad organization.

At Siemens, I had worked extensively with Java, Eclipse RCP, Eclipse GEF, 
JMeter, UML modelling tools and coverage criteria 
to automatize the generation of test artifacts.
