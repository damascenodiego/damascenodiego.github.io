In July 19th, I was invited to participate in the 
fifth episode of the FacompCast, 
a podcast organized by students and the teachers of the Faculty of Computing at the 
Federal University of Par√° (FACOMP-UFPA).

As a former UFPA graduate of the Computer Science course,
the FacompCast organizers invited me to talk a little about my 
trajectory during my academic life, decisions and challenges of the scientific world.
That was my first experience in a podcast and 
it was great to meet old friends again!
