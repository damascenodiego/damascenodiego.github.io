In October 29th, I was an invited speaker at the National Week of Science and Technology
of the Federal Institute of Education, Science and Technology of Maranhão
(in portuguese, Semana Nacional de Ciência e Tecnologia - SNCT/IFMA).

In this event, I presented the talk  
"Sustentabilidade de Software e Gestão de Dados de Pesquisa Científica" 
where I cover the basic of research artifacts, 
the benefits of artifact sharing,
the lifecycle of research data, and 
the challenges of discussing artifact quality.
The talk was given in portuguese (pt-BR).

The video recording of this talk is available on
