I'm attending the 
23rd International Systems and 
Software Product Line Conference (SPLC 2019)
to present my paper entitled 
**Learning from difference: 
an automated approach for learning family models from 
software product lines**.

The SPLC 2019 has received an overall number of 
13 artifact submissions, and only 19 papers were accepted. 
From those 13 submissions, 
5 received the reusable badge and 6 the functional badge.


The paper has been accepted as *Research Article* and 
received the *Functional artifact* badge.
The reference to the paper is available in the 
[Publication](https://damascenodiego.github.io/publications/) 
section of my personal page.

The SPLC 2019 will be held from September 9th to 13th 
in Paris, France.
