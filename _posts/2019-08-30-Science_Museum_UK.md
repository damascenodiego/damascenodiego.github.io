In August 29th 2019, 
the Driverleics group has been invited by Science Museum (London)to present 
their exhibit *Trusted autonomous vehicles* in 
their <a href='https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/see-and-do/lates'>Lates</a>.
The *Lates* are adults-only, after-hours theme nights that take place 
every last Wednesday of month in the Science Museum.

The exhibit *Trusted autonomous vehicles* included the following activities:

- A fully autonomous vehicle (scale 1:8, shown above) 
driving on a 3m x 5m track where 
visitors could place a pedestrian in a "dangerous situation".
-  A simulator with challenging test scenarios developed for 
assessing driving quality of drivers.
-  A showcase of basic building blocks of autonomous vehicles 
from object detection and classification.



It was a great pleasure to interact with so many visitors
and share a little of my knowledge on software testing!
