In collaboration with Daniel Struber, we proposed the idea of 
"family-based fingerprinting", an approach that combines product-line, 
security and model learning principles to analyze behavioral signatures from software variants.

A position paper discussing this idea was published in the book dedicated to 
Frits Vaandrager on the occasion of his 60th birthday.
A preprint is available in my [Publications page](https://damascenodiego.github.io/publications/).
The complete proceedings is available at [Springer](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-15629-8_8).
