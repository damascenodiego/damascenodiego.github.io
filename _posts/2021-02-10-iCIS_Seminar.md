Today I had my first presentation at the iCIS seminar in Radboud University.
In December 2020, I joined Radboud University and it's been a great experience to work with them!

In my first presentation, I showed some of the main findings of my recently published paper at the Empirical Software Engineering Journal.
In this paper, I introduce an approach for learning 150% models from Mealy machines representing product line instances.
The presentation is available [here]({{ '/assets/pdf/EMSE2021_slides.pptx' | relative_url }}) and can be seen below.
