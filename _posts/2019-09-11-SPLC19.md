This September I attended the 
<a href='https://splc2019.net'>
23rd International Systems and Software Product Line Conference (SPLC)
</a>.
The SPLC is a premier forum where researchers, practitioners, and educators can present and discuss 
the most recent ideas, trends, experiences, and challenges in the area of 
software and system product lines engineering.

At the SPLC conference, 
I published and presented the first paper from my PhD and
worked at the conference as student volunteer.

The paper I presented is entitled 
<a href='https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3336294.3336307'>Learning from Difference: An Automated Approach for Learning Family Models from Software Product Lines</a>.
In this work, I discuss some of the findings of my PhD where 
I investigate the problem of learning state-based models from product families.
To tackle this issue, I proposed a technique that 
compares, merges and annotates finite-state machines (FSM) describing 
product instances from an SPL into a 
<a href='https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-57666-4_13'>featured finite state machine (FFSM)</a>.

We envisage that this approach can support the formal analysis of 
product families when there are no models available.
Thus, our technique can pave the way for efficient model-based analyis of SPLs.
