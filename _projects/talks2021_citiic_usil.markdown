In August 23rd, I was invited to the
_Congreso Internacional de Tecnología e Innovación en Ingeniería y Computación_
(CITIIC).
In my talk,  
I presented the main results of my EMSE paper
"Learning by Sampling: Learning behavioral family models from software product lines".
This congress was held virtually by the _Universidad San Ignacio de Loyola_ (USIL), in Peru.
