The Academic CV project is a LaTeX template which I have been adapting over the years to maintain my 
academic curriculum. The project is available on:

- Overleaf, as a [template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/academic-cv-by-diego/nsnhjwcyxnbt)
- GitHub, as a [public repository](https://github.com/damascenodiego/Academic-CV-by-Diego)


This template is a single-column CV for academics. 
It has conditional compilation tags for showing/hiding fields with 
personal information (e.g., phone number, Gmail, Skype) and professional references. 
Page margins are also customizable.

Among the fields included in the template, you find sections for:

- Personal Information
- Education (e.g., Degrees)
- Professional, Pedagogical, and Academic Experiences (e.g., Research and Industry, membership in research laboratories)
- Student Supervisions and Membership in Examination Board Committees 
- Publications
- Community Services
- Volunteering
- Honors, Awards, and Scholarships
- Schools and Workshops Participation
- Tools and Artifacts
- Personal Interests
- Languages
- References
