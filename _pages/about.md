According to a recent report by [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-27IIPKYV&ct=210923&st=sb), 
the future of software development is predicted to rely heavily on model-based methodologies, 
with over 65% of all software development functions adopting this approach. 
Despite this exciting potential, much work must be done before software engineering becomes truly "model-based".

I am a software engineer and researcher working on 
developing model-based tools and methodologies for testing advanced lithography systems. 
I invite you to explore my website and learn more about my
[career](https://damascenodiego.github.io/cv/), and
[publications](https://damascenodiego.github.io/publications/). 
For my latest activities, please visit my social media profiles and research portfolios.
