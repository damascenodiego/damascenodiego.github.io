According to a recent report by [Gartner](https://www.gartner.com/doc/reprints?id=1-27IIPKYV&ct=210923&st=sb), 
the future of software development is predicted to rely heavily on model-based methodologies, 
with over 65% of all software development functions adopting this approach. 
Despite this exciting potential, much work must be done before software engineering becomes truly "model-based".

I am a postdoctoral researcher at [Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/english/people/nascimento-damasceno-c/), 
affiliated with the Department of Software Science ([SwS]([SwS](https://mbsd.cs.ru.nl/))). 
I am passionate about addressing the challenges of constructing and managing software models. 
Over the last decade, I have been dedicated to developing the next generation of model-based tools and methodologies for designing and analyzing complex software systems 
while using empirical methods to inform researchers and practitioners about the efficiency and effectiveness of model-based software engineering.

I invite you to explore my website and learn more about my
[career](https://damascenodiego.github.io/cv/),
[stories](https://damascenodiego.github.io/blog/), and
[publications](https://damascenodiego.github.io/publications/)
as I strive to shape the future of software engineering through cutting-edge model-based research and development. 

Join me on this exciting journey towards a world with more efficient, effective, and model-based software engineering methodologies!
