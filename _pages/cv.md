Long bio
------

Diego Damasceno 
[//]: # (His research interests range from empirical software engineering, software product lines, software testing, model learning, and research software artifacts.)
is a former _Postdoctoral Researcher_ at the _Institute for Computing and
Information Sciences ([ICIS](https://www.ru.nl/icis/))_ of
**[Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/english/people/nascimento-damasceno-c/)**. 
At Radboud University, he developed research in model-based and product-line engineering. 
He performed teaching and student supervision activities at the BSc and MSc levels.
From March to November 2020, he worked as a _Student supervisor_ and _Online tutor_ in 
the [Postgraduate Program in Computing Applied to Education](http://especializacao.icmc.usp.br/) 
at the University of Sao Paulo (CAE-USP).
At the CAE-USP, he supervised six postgraduate students developing term
papers on _Educational Data Mining_.
He also worked on producing educational video content for a module on _Scientific Writing and Methodology_.

Between 2016 and 2020, he was a research assistant and PhD candidate at the University of São
Paulo ([ICMC-USP](http://icmc.usp.br/)) under the joint supervision
of [Adenilso Simao](http://lattes.cnpq.br/9836776931160228)
and [Mohammad Mousavi](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/mohammad-reza-mousavi). During his doctoral studies, he spent one
year as Visiting PhD Student Researcher at the [University of Leicester](https://le.ac.uk/informatics/), performing
research in the broad field of software engineering. In
his [PhD thesis](http://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/55/55134/tde-02092020-091958/), he investigated techniques to
construct finite state machine models from evolving systems.

He earned his Master's degree in Computer Science (2014-2016) also from the ICMC-USP. In
his [MSc thesis](http://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/55/55134/tde-11112016-101158/), he performed studies in
model-based test generation and prioritization for Role-Based Access Control systems and empirical software engineering.

He holds a Bachelor's in Computer Science (2008-2014) from
the [Federal University of Pará (UFPa)](http://www.icen.ufpa.br/). During his undergraduate course, he had working and
research experiences as a _Software Engineering Intern_
at [Siemens](https://new.siemens.com/us/en/company/siemens-in-the-usa/princeton.html), and _Scientific Initiation
Fellow_ of multiple research laboratories at UFPa, including Software Engineering
Laboratory ([LabES](http://www.labes.ufpa.br/)), High-Performance Network Planning
Laboratory ([LPRAD](http://lprad.ufpa.br/)), and Laboratory of Computational
Intelligence ([LINC](http://linc.ufpa.br/)).
