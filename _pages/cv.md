Long bio
------

Diego Damasceno is currently a Design Engineer at [ASML](https://www.asml.com/).
At ASML, he works on developing modeling and model-based testing methodologies for 
semiconductor manufacturing.

He is a former _Postdoctoral Researcher_ at the _Institute for Computing and
Information Sciences ([ICIS](https://www.ru.nl/icis/))_ of
**[Radboud University](https://www.ru.nl/english/people/nascimento-damasceno-c/)**. 
At Radboud University, he developed research in model-based and product-line engineering, 
and teaching and student supervision activities at the BSc and MSc levels.

From March to November 2020, he worked as a _Student supervisor_ and _Online tutor_ in 
the [Postgraduate Program in Computing Applied to Education](http://especializacao.icmc.usp.br/) 
at the University of Sao Paulo (CAE-USP).
At the CAE-USP, 
he supervised six postgraduate students developing term papers on _Educational Data Mining_, 
and produced educational video content for a module on _Scientific Writing and Methodology_.

Between 2014 and 2020, he pursued Msc and PhD degrees in Computer Science and Computational Mathematics at the University of São
Paulo ([ICMC-USP](http://icmc.usp.br/)). 
During his doctoral studies, he worked under the joint supervision
of [Adenilso Simao](http://lattes.cnpq.br/9836776931160228)
and [Mohammad Mousavi](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/mohammad-reza-mousavi). He spent one
year as Visiting PhD Student Researcher at the [University of Leicester](https://le.ac.uk/informatics/), performing
research in the broad field of software engineering. 
In his [PhD thesis](http://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/55/55134/tde-02092020-091958/), 
he investigated techniques to construct finite state machine models from evolving systems.
In his [MSc thesis](http://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/55/55134/tde-11112016-101158/), 
he performed studies in model-based test generation and prioritization for Role-Based Access Control systems.

He holds a Bachelor's in Computer Science (2008-2014) from the [Federal University of Pará (UFPa)](http://www.icen.ufpa.br/). 
During his undergraduate course, he had working and research experiences as a 
_Software Engineering Intern_ at [Siemens](https://new.siemens.com/us/en/company/siemens-in-the-usa/princeton.html), and 
_Scientific Initiation Fellow_ in multiple research laboratories at UFPa, including 
Software Engineering Laboratory ([LabES](http://www.labes.ufpa.br/)), 
High-Performance Network Planning Laboratory ([LPRAD](http://lprad.ufpa.br/)), and 
Laboratory of Computational Intelligence ([LINC](http://linc.ufpa.br/)).
